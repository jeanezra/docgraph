As part of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Fred Trotter requested physician "referral" data. This repo uses the within 30-day "referral" data from Medicare in 2012.

The goal is to merge the dataset with the National Plan & Provider Enumeration System (NPPES) dataset, as well as other useful open health data resources for a social network analysis. 

A JSON file is created to visualize the data in D3; a delimited file is created to do analysis in Gephi, an open source social network analysis software; and an adjacency matrix is created to perform more sophisticated analysis using machine learning algorithms.
